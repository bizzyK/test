# Tech Assessment

Welcome to the technical assessment! This repository contains a simple setup for a React/NextJS frontend, a Node.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database. Your task will be to implement specific features using Test-Driven Development (TDD) while collaborating through Pair Programming.

---

## **Overview**
This application has the following functionality pre-configured:
- **Frontend**: A basic React/NextJS app with a form to add employees (not yet functional).
- **Backend**: A Node.js API with an existing endpoint to retrieve employees.
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database with an `employees` table.

Your task:
1. Implement the "add" endpoint in the backend to save employees to the database.
2. Update the frontend to display employees fetched from the database.
